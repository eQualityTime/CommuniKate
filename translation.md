Hi there!

I understand you’ve been using one of our communiKate sheets, which is fantastic news! We love hearing from anyone whose found that they work for them. It really keeps us going.  

I’m told that you are interested in helping translate CommuniKate so that more people can use it - that would be amazing! The more people that help us with translations and customisations, the more people we can help globally! 

Let me take you though how this works.  

Everything we do is prototyped first in PowerPoint, just because that’s a very common program that lots of people access.  We can give you the raw PowerPoint version of the pages you’ve been using and all you have to do is change the labels so that they are understandable in the target language.   Here are links to the three boards we have - you can pick which ever one you’d like to translate.

You should also feel free to take out any symbols that are unnecessary in the target language - for example CommuniKate involves a lot of very British and American foods that might in inappropriate in some countries - so translations often change these for more useful words.   The same applys to measurements and some types of shops.  

Once you’ve completed a translation - if you send it to us, then we can make it publicly available on our website so that many other people can make use of your work.  

I’d be really proud to be able to show people photos of CommuniKate being translated or used in Afghanistan, we’re really proud to have you on board.  

We’ll also print out a large, waterproof version of the board and post it over to you to say thanks. 

Joe
