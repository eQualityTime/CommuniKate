# Completed Translations


# Translations in Progress


# Translating the Pageset
So you are interested in translating CommuniKate to be used in another langugae? That's fantastic news! We love hearing from anyone whose found that they work for them. It really keeps us going.  The more people that help us with translations and customisations, the more people we can help globally! 

Let's do a quick overview of how this works. Everything we do is prototyped first in PowerPoint, just because that’s a very common program that lots of people access.  We give you the raw PowerPoint version of the pages you’ve been using and all you have to do is change the labels so that they are understandable in the target language.   


You should also feel free to take out any symbols that are unnecessary in the target language - for example CommuniKate involves a lot of very British and American foods that might in inappropriate in some countries - so translations often change these for more useful words.   The same applies to measurements and some types of shops.  

Once you’ve completed a translation - if you send it to us, then we can make it publicly available above so that many other people can make use of your work.  

All of our templates are designed to work with the [Open Voice Factory](http://theopenvoicefactory.org), and that site has plenty to videos showing how to add pictures and insert special commands. You can also put your templates thought the upload page to see what they would look and sound like with the right localised voice. 



## Where can I find the files to start with?
If you are putting CK into language we've never had before, then please start from either this one, or this one. If you want to make changes to, or finish one of the sets in this place, please do. Sometimes it is good to start from the language of a close country (like Portugal and Spain) because, even if the words are very different, some of the changes that have been made to the symbols, will save you a lot of time. 


## Can I continue one of the incomplete translations? 
Please do! We're aware these can be big jobs so we really like it when people share the effort. This also means that if you get half way thought a translation - you can send us it and we'll put it up for others to use.  


## How close do my changes have to be. 
We want CK to feel 'local' in every language. So some things might need translating carefully ("I am sick"), but some pages might need changing a lot (The breakfast food page would have different things on it) and some pages might need removing (some places want an entire page for cheese, others want to remove the page for alachol. To find out more about how to add new pages and change links, please see this page. 

## Should I change the images?
Please do. Many of the images we have used make sense where we are, but not in other places. Try to chose symbols that are clear and avoid photos. Also - please make sure that the symbols you use are under a Creative Common's licence - that way we can share your work with others. 


## I am changing this for someone important to me, can I just send you the one that they use?
You can, but it please take out any private information first (my brother's Voice has his address on it).  In a perfect world, you would do the translation first, send it to us, and then put in all of the user's favourite things. However, we know that we would want to sort out the people important to us first. 

## What shall I do about slang?
Slang is very interesting.  We would say that it's best to change the slang words to use the words that teenagers would use - those words are so the user can say 'who they are' rather than 'what they need' so they don't need to be a direct translation.
