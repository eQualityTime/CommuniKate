CommuniKate is heavily documented, you can read all about its design and use in our [80page manual](https://github.com/joereddington/CommuniKate/blob/master/CommuniKateManualLaunch.docx?raw=true), and play with our online demos of both [CK20](http://communikate.joereddington.com/releases/v1/ck20/en/) and [CK12](http://communikate.joereddington.com/releases/v2/ck12/en/) before you download.  

The demos are fully interactive online versions of the page set. There is a [Portuguese version](http://communikate.joereddington.com/releases/v1/ck20/por/) of the CK20 demo, and we have volunteers currently translating for a range of languages. If you are interested in helping us translate the page set to any other language weâ€™d love to hear from you.
