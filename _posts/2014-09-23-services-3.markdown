CommuniKate is heavily documented, you can read all about its design and use in our [80page manual](https://github.com/joereddington/CommuniKate/blob/master/CommuniKateManualLaunch.docx?raw=true), and play with our online demos of both [CK20](http://equalitytime.github.io/CommuniKate/demos/CK20V2.pptx/) and [CK12](http://equalitytime.github.io/CommuniKate/demos/CK12+V2.pptx/) before you download.  

The demos are fully interactive online versions of the page set. There are more demos on the translation page.
