You can download the CommuniKate 20 page set in the correct formats for:

#### Tobii DynaVox

We have versions for:

*   [DynaVox Series 5](http://communikate.joereddington.com/downloads/ck20/CK20_dynavox.User)
*   [DynaVox Compass](http://communikate.joereddington.com/downloads/ck20/CK20_dynavox_compass.bzf)

Both versions use PCS symbols rather than the Mulberry set used in CommuiKate and continues some small additions to the normal CommuniKate set â€“ this includes such things as some extra examples of birds in the animal category and several other minor language changes. (Thanks to [Will Wade](http://appsforaac.net/blogs/willwade) for the Compass conversion)

#### Others

We have several other formats in preparation. If you'd like to port CommuniKate 20 to a new device then you are absolutely free to do so! (we'd be very grateful if you'd send us the relevant files so that we can put them up here so other people can make use of them). If you'd just like to look at the page sets - then the **PowerPoint design document is [here](https://github.com/joereddington/CommuniKate/blob/master/ck20/CK20V2.pptx?raw=true)**.
